Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

Incy Wincy spider climbed up the waterspout,
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain,
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the spout again.

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.
